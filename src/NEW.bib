abstract = {Numerous methodologies for developing agent-based systems have been proposed in the literature. However, their application is still limited due to their lack of maturity. Evaluating methodologies' strengths and weaknesses plays an important role in improving them and in developing the “next-generation” of methodologies. This paper presents a comparison of three prominent agentoriented methodologies: MaSE, Prometheus and Tropos. It is performed based upon an attribute-based framework which addresses four major areas: concepts, modelling language, process and pragmatics. The objectivity of the comparison is increased by including inputs from the authors of the methodologies using a questionnaire and by conducting an experimental evaluation of the methodologies.},

abstract = {Systems composed of interacting autonomous agents offer a promising software engineering approach for developing applications in complex domains. However, this multiagent system paradigm introduces a number of new abstractions and design/development issues when compared with more traditional approaches to software development. Accordingly, new analysis and design methodologies, as well as new tools, are needed to effectively engineer such systems. Against this background, the contribution of this article is twofold. First, we synthesize and clarify the key abstractions of agent-based computing as they pertain to agent-oriented software engineering. In particular, we argue that a multiagent system can naturally be viewed and architected as a computational organization, and we identify the appropriate organizational abstractions that are central to the analysis and design of such systems. Second, we detail and extend the Gaia methodology for the analysis and design of multiagent systems. Gaia exploits the aforementioned organizational abstractions to provide clear guidelines for the analysis and design of complex and open software systems. Two representative case studies are introduced to exemplify Gaia's concepts and to show its use and effectiveness in different types of multiagent system.},

Smart grids employ digital technology and are based on highly collaborative and responsive decision-making strategies. Current trends to control and manage their operation lead to the use of multi-agent system (MAS) technology. This paper aims to present the design, specification, and application of the Python Agent DEvelopment (PADE) framework, an open source platform implemented in Python language and conceived for the implementation of multi-agent systems on power systems. PADE is compliant with specifications of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents and eases the development of solutions to power systems based on MAS. For demonstration of the effectiveness of PADE, an automatic restoration system MAS-based is presented. A test bed that encompasses agents embedded on computation devices is used to demonstrate the practical implementation of a PADE-based multi-agent systems in a power distribution network.},

@article{Koch2020,
abstract = {In this paper, we take a novel approach to study the empirical relationship between public debate in the media and asylum acceptance rates in Europe from 2002–2016. In theory, an asylum seeker should experience the same likelihood of being granted refugee status from each of the 20 European countries we study. Yet, in practice, acceptance rates vary widely for nearly every asylum country of origin. We address this inconsistency with a data-driven approach by analyzing refugee-related news articles and data on asylum decisions across 20 Europe countries for more than 100 asylum seekers' countries of origin. We find that: (i) public debate sentiment in the media is strongly associated with European countries' diverging asylum practices, much more so than social, cultural or economic factors, and (ii) by combining different measures of public debate we can make out-of-sample predictions within 3{\%} of true acceptance rates (on average). We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings for European asylum practices.},

In this work, a significance-driven framework is proposed to characterize the evolution of local topology and find dynamic patterns with evidently statistical significance for temporally varying news report networks. Two significance indices-potential index and evolving score are introduced for evaluating evolving patterns. Finally, we present a systematic analysis of one real news network, which demonstrates that the method we proposed can find the evolving characteristic and extract significant dynamic patterns from news networks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The growing demand for affordable, reliable, domestically sourced, and low-carbon electricity is a matter of concern and it is driven by several causes including public policy priorities. Policy objectives and new technologies are changing wholesale market design. The analysis of different aspects of energy markets is increasingly on the agendas of academics, firms' managers or policy makers. Some concerns are global and are related to the evolution of climate change phenomena. Others are regional or national and they strongly appear in countries like Spain with a high dependence on foreign energy sources and high potential of domestic renewable energy sources. We can find a relevant case in Spanish solar energy policy. A series of regulatory reforms since 2010 reduce revenues to existing renewable power generators and they end up the previous system of support to new renewable generation. This policy change has altered the composition of the energy market affecting investment decisions. In this paper, we analyze the public opinion about energy policy of the Spanish Government using the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The GDELT Project consists of over a quarter-billion event records in over 300 categories covering the entire world from 1979 to present, along with a massive network diagram connecting every person, organization, location, and theme to this event database. Our aim is to build sentiment indicators arising from this source of information and, in a final step, evaluate if positive and negative indexes have any effect on the evolution of key market variables as prices and demand.},

We used the recent Arab Spring as a case study, and examined temporal trends in monthly time series of variables which we hypothesized to indicate conflict intensity, covering all Arab countries. Both Flickr photos and night-time lights proved as sensitive indicators for loss of economic and human capital, and news items from the Global Data on Events, Location and Tone (GDELT) project on fight events were positively correlated with actual deaths from conflicts. We propose that big data and remote sensing datasets have potential to provide disaggregated and timely data on conflicts where official statistics are lacking, offering an effective approach for monitoring geopolitical and environmental changes on Earth.},

abstract = {Nowadays, sustained development of different social media can be observed worldwide. One of the relevant research domains intensively explored recently is analysis of social communities existing in social media as well as prediction of their future evolution taking into account collected historical evolution chains. These evolution chains proposed in the paper contain group states in the previous time frames and its historical transitions that were identified using one out of two methods: Stable Group Changes Identification (SGCI) and Group Evolution Discovery (GED). Based on the observed evolution chains of various length, structural network features are extracted, validated and selected as well as used to learn classification models. The experimental studies were performed on three real datasets with different profile: DBLP, Facebook and Polish blogosphere. The process of group prediction was analysed with respect to different classifiers as well as various descriptive feature sets extracted from evolution chains of different length. The results revealed that, in general, the longer evolution chains the better predictive abilities of the classification models. However, chains of length 3 to 7 enabled the GED-based method to almost reach its maximum possible prediction quality. For SGCI, this value was at the level of 3-5 last periods.},

abstract = {Tone of a news report is intimately related to the topic of the article, and therefore can reflect the attitude of journalists or media. It is often thought that tone of news report, especially the international news, is affected by ideology. To test whether this is the case, we use GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) to compare the tone of international news reports among nine countries, the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany, China, Nigeria, Argentina, Zimbabwe and United Arab Emirates. We find that albeit international news reported by different countries differ significantly in event types, they nevertheless converge in tone. The former reflects the different preferences in content selection by each country, and thus reflect culture. The convergence in tone reflects the fact that reporters are not overly influenced by their respective ideology; rather they share to a large degree some universal values when covering international news.},

abstract = {Global cities act as influential hubs in the networked world. Their city brands, which are projected by the global news media, are becoming sustainable resources in various global competitions and cooperations. This study adopts the research paradigm of computational social science to assess and compare the city brand attention, positivity, and influence of ten Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) Alpha+ global cities, along with their dimensional structures, based on combining the cognitive and affective theoretical perspectives on the frameworks of the Anholt global city brand dimension system, the big data of global news knowledge graph in Google's Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), and the technologies of word-embedding semantic mining and clustering analysis. The empirical results show that the overall values and dimensional structures of city brand influence of global cities form distinct levels and clusters, respectively. Although global cities share a common structural characteristic of city brand influence of the dimensions of presence and potential being most prominent, Western and Eastern global cities differentiate in the clustering of dimensional structures of city brand attention, positivity, and influence. City brand attention is more important than city brand positivity in improving the city brand influence of global cities. The preferences of the global news media over global city brands fits the nature of global cities.},

abstract = {Climate change affects the lives of millions of people. While much attention has been paid to the biophysical impacts of climate change, researchers have little empirical information on the impacts on human society. Climate related social challenges are difficult to accurately measure. One recent data source, the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project, could close that gap. It monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, and events driving our global society. Increasingly, big data sources like GDELT are being used to understand how changing actors, events and sentiment in the news media can help understand social change. By analyzing GDELT's data, applications, and methods, this review identifies the potential of this new data source for the increasingly important role that computational social science can play alongside established biophysical data in monitoring largescale environmental change.},

Our interest in this paper is from the perspective of peace keeping organizations such as United Nations and Red Cross that can benefit from information aggregated from different sources to make important decisions. GDELT project is one such source where data about conflicts is aggregated from various newspaper sources around the globe. This paper makes three contributions to the analysis of peace and conflict data available on GDELT. First, the paper presents two case studies to investigate whether the data extracted from news items in fact captures the global events accurately. The case studies considered were the Sri Lankan civil war, and the 2006 Fijian coup. Second, in these case studies, the study demonstrates how change point analysis can be used to identify important trends which will be valuable for making decisions. Third, based on experience gained through the exploration of these two case studies, it proposes a conceptual model of a multi-level analysis in the form of a dashboard system that would be of interest to different stakeholders.},

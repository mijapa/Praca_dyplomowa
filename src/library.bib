abstract = {Huge amounts of news items are being published from various sources around the world. Our interest in this paper is from the perspective of peace keeping organizations such as United Nations and Red Cross that can benefit from information aggregated from different sources to make important decisions. GDELT project is one such source where data about conflicts is aggregated from various newspaper sources around the globe. This paper makes three contributions to the analysis of peace and conflict data available on GDELT. First, the paper presents two case studies to investigate whether the data extracted from news items in fact captures the global events accurately. The case studies considered were the Sri Lankan civil war, and the 2006 Fijian coup. Second, in these case studies, the study demonstrates how change point analysis can be used to identify important trends which will be valuable for making decisions. Third, based on experience gained through the exploration of these two case studies, it proposes a conceptual model of a multi-level analysis in the form of a dashboard system that would be of interest to different stakeholders.},

abstract = {The growing demand for affordable, reliable, domestically sourced, and low-carbon electricity is a matter of concern and it is driven by several causes including public policy priorities. Policy objectives and new technologies are changing wholesale market design. The analysis of different aspects of energy markets is increasingly on the agendas of academics, firms' managers or policy makers. Some concerns are global and are related to the evolution of climate change phenomena. Others are regional or national and they strongly appear in countries like Spain with a high dependence on foreign energy sources and high potential of domestic renewable energy sources. We can find a relevant case in Spanish solar energy policy. A series of regulatory reforms since 2010 reduce revenues to existing renewable power generators and they end up the previous system of support to new renewable generation. This policy change has altered the composition of the energy market affecting investment decisions. In this paper, we analyze the public opinion about energy policy of the Spanish Government using the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The GDELT Project consists of over a quarter-billion event records in over 300 categories covering the entire world from 1979 to present, along with a massive network diagram connecting every person, organization, location, and theme to this event database. Our aim is to build sentiment indicators arising from this source of information and, in a final step, evaluate if positive and negative indexes have any effect on the evolution of key market variables as prices and demand.},

abstract = {Global cities act as influential hubs in the networked world. Their city brands, which are projected by the global news media, are becoming sustainable resources in various global competitions and cooperations. This study adopts the research paradigm of computational social science to assess and compare the city brand attention, positivity, and influence of ten Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) Alpha+ global cities, along with their dimensional structures, based on combining the cognitive and affective theoretical perspectives on the frameworks of the Anholt global city brand dimension system, the big data of global news knowledge graph in Google's Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), and the technologies of word-embedding semantic mining and clustering analysis. The empirical results show that the overall values and dimensional structures of city brand influence of global cities form distinct levels and clusters, respectively. Although global cities share a common structural characteristic of city brand influence of the dimensions of presence and potential being most prominent, Western and Eastern global cities differentiate in the clustering of dimensional structures of city brand attention, positivity, and influence. City brand attention is more important than city brand positivity in improving the city brand influence of global cities. The preferences of the global news media over global city brands fits the nature of global cities.},

abstract = {The rapid development of big data techniques provides growing opportunities to investigate large-scale events that emerge over space and time. This research utilizes a unique open-access dataset, “The Global Data on Events, Location and Tone” (GDELT), to model how China has connected to the rest of the world, as well as predicting how this connection may evolve over time based on an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Methodologically, we examined the effectiveness of traditional time series models in predicting trends in long-term mass media data. Empirically, we identified various types of ARIMA models to depict the connection patterns between China and its top 15 related countries. This study demonstrates the power of applying GDELT and big data analytics to investigate informative patterns for interdisciplinary researchers, as well as provides valuable references to interpret regional patterns and international relations in the age of instant access.},

abstract = {The development of theories and techniques for big data analytics offers tremendous possibility for investigating large-scale events and patterns that emerge over space and time. In this research, we utilize a unique open dataset “The Global Data on Events, Location and Tone” (GDELT) to model the image of China in mass media, specifically, how China has related to the rest of the world and how this connection has evolved upon time. The results of this research contribute to both the methodological and the empirical perspectives: We examined the effectiveness of the dynamic time warping (DTW) distances in measuring the differences between long-term mass media data. We identified four types of connection strength patterns between China and its top 15 related countries. With that, the distance decay effect in mass media is also examined and compared with social media and public transportation data. While using multiple datasets and focusing on mass media, this study generates valuable input regarding the interpretation of the diplomatic and regional correlation for the nation of China. It also provides methodological references for investigating international relations in other countries and regions in the big data era.},

@article{Ma2017,
abstract = {Tone of a news report is intimately related to the topic of the article, and therefore can reflect the attitude of journalists or media. It is often thought that tone of news report, especially the international news, is affected by ideology. To test whether this is the case, we use GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) to compare the tone of international news reports among nine countries, the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany, China, Nigeria, Argentina, Zimbabwe and United Arab Emirates. We find that albeit international news reported by different countries differ significantly in event types, they nevertheless converge in tone. The former reflects the different preferences in content selection by each country, and thus reflect culture. The convergence in tone reflects the fact that reporters are not overly influenced by their respective ideology; rather they share to a large degree some universal values when covering international news.},

@article{Koch2020,
abstract = {In this paper, we take a novel approach to study the empirical relationship between public debate in the media and asylum acceptance rates in Europe from 2002–2016. In theory, an asylum seeker should experience the same likelihood of being granted refugee status from each of the 20 European countries we study. Yet, in practice, acceptance rates vary widely for nearly every asylum country of origin. We address this inconsistency with a data-driven approach by analyzing refugee-related news articles and data on asylum decisions across 20 Europe countries for more than 100 asylum seekers' countries of origin. We find that: (i) public debate sentiment in the media is strongly associated with European countries' diverging asylum practices, much more so than social, cultural or economic factors, and (ii) by combining different measures of public debate we can make out-of-sample predictions within 3{\%} of true acceptance rates (on average). We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings for European asylum practices.},

abstract = {Researchers have long been interested in the role that norms can play in governing agent actions in multi-agent systems. Much work has been done on formalising normative concepts from human society and adapting them for the government of open software systems, and on the simulation of normative processes in human and artificial societies. However, there has been comparatively little work on applying normative MAS mechanisms to understanding the norms in human society. This work investigates this issue in the context of international politics. Using the GDELT dataset, containing machine-encoded records of international events extracted from news reports, we extracted bilateral sequences of inter-country events and applied a Bayesian norm mining mechanism to identify norms that best explained the observed behaviour. A statistical evaluation showed that the normative model fitted the data significantly better than a probabilistic discrete event model.},
